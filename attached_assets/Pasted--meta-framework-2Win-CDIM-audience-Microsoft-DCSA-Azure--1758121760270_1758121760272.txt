  "executive_summary": "Garrett Brands is progressing on a Fabric medallion architecture and plans to use Fabric Data Agents to let users chat with trusted data inside M365 Copilot. Strengths include clear intent to right-size agents by business process, a security-first mindset (Entra ID groups, RBAC, and views), and phased pilots with prompt guidance. Weaknesses are the absence of defined success metrics, unclear final security pattern (workspace versus RLS versus views and CMK), and reliance on preview features. The most material gap is a lack of measurable pilot objectives across finance and HR. The single most important next step is to select the first pilot process and lock baseline, target, timeframe, and owner for success measurement.",
